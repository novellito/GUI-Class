# Project 4 - Facebook Lite

How to get started:

After cloning the repo, run `npm install`

To develop on the application simply type `npm run dev` - this will spin the electron app as well as the browser app (dont worry about the browser)

In addition, another server must be running in the background to fetch data from the database. Go into the react-background folder and type `npm start`. This will start up the server and you can see the data which is being fetched, by going into your browser and typing `localhost:5000`.
